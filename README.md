### 01/04/2021 Inizio primo esercizio - Matrix Dot Vector Problem

**Parallelize and Evaluate Performances of "Matrix dot Vector" Algorithm , by using OpenMP.**

Provide (different if you need) solutions to the problem of parallelize "Matrix dot Vector" Algorithm.

Your report has to include:

- A description of the problem
- A description of your experimental setup
- The HW you use (CPUs type, Ram, Virtual machines configuration (if any), colab setup (if any) etc. )
- The SW you use (Operating system version and main configuration like dimension of Swap files/partition, libraries version, compiler versions, etc. )
- Any time you describe a result: compiler configuration and options, workload description, environment variables etc.)
- Performances, Speedup, Efficiency and other considerations
- Describe and Motivate your results
- Describe different solutions
- Describe and motivate your optimal configuration
- A Description of the test cases
- Your APIs description (if any)
- Description on how to setup a system to reproduce (automatically) your results (of course on a different system)

If you use Colab, include the notebook as attachment (do not copy the notebook in the pdf ...)
