Parallelize and Evaluate Performances of "Matrix dot Matrix" Algorithm , by using MPI.

Matrix multiplication to use is the "raw - column" multiplication, where elements or result matrix is obtained by scalar multiplication of one raw of the first Matrix for one raw of the second Matrix



Use  MPI DataTypes to model raw and column types

Evaluate performances when reading files with different MPI I/O approaches

Provide (different if you need) solutions to the problem of parallelize "Matrix dot Matrix" Algorithm.

Your report has to include:

- A description of the problem
- A description of your experimental setup
	- The HW you use (CPUs type, Ram, Virtual machines configuration (if any), colab setup (if any) etc. )
	- The SW you use (Operating system version and main configuration like dimension of Swap files/partition, libraries version, compiler versions, etc. )
	- Any time you describe a result: compiler configuration and options, workload description, environment variables etc.)
- Performances, Speedup, Efficiency and other considerations
	- Describe and Motivate your results
	- Describe different solutions
	- Describe and motivate your optimal configuration
- A Description of the test cases
- your APIs description (if any)
- Description on how to setup a system to reproduce (automatically) your results (of course on a different system)
- If you use Colab, include the notebook as attachment (do not copy the notebook in the pdf ...)


Provide the source code (makefile, folders etc.) to test and reproduce your results as described in the general section of Final Projects Assignments
